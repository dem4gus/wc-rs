A (mostly complete) reimplementation of `wc` in Rust.
Idea for the project comes from [CodingChallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc).

I didn't end up implementing the max line length function or reading multiple files.
I might do that in the future if I get bored and want to revisit this.
Also, I'm aware that having stuff like `unwrap()` in finished code is considered not great.
